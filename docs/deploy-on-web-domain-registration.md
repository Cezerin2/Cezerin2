## Register domain

1. We have hosting (digitalocean droplet) for our cezerin web site.

Now we need a domain name, to open our store like this

```
https://cezerin.net
```

not by ip address like:

```
https://123.456.789.0
```

2. You need to register any domain name at any domain registrator.

For example, we have cezerin.net domain and we need to make available cezerin online store on https://cezerin.net

3. Ok, we have domain name and we have domain name control panel.

Let's go to attach domain and hosting.
